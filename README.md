Pokemon Brick Bronze Auto Hunter is an automated tool for hunting Pokemon in the popular Roblox game Pokemon Brick Bronze. This program uses image recognition and automated key movements to do your Pokemon hunting while you afk. 

Yes this program is good enough to do shiny hunting. 

## Quick Start Instructions: 
1. Please find the Pokemon you are looking for from the following websites:

            Normal Hunting: https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/sprites/xyani/
            Shiny Hunting;  https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/sprites/xyani-shiny/
            
   Save As and store the image in the image_folder.

2. please Open Roblox and head to the tall grass 
            where you intend to do your shiny hunting with ample space to move around

3. Open the Application, Hit Start, click into roblox within the startup time and leave your computer on!

   Now you are free to leave the computer, and let it do its thing. When the program finds a match it will 'idle' (click around on the screen) to keep you from being disconnected.

## Other Notes: 

  -This program only works for 16x9 monitors so no CRTS or ultrawide screens as I don't have those to test on.

  -I have a general "threshold" that works on most pokemon, if you are having trouble with false negatives or positives, please bring it down and check with the debug function.

  -In the Advanced section, you have a threshold, which is 0.15 by standard. If you are having false positives (sayin there is a pokemon match when there is not), bring it down by  dividing in half until you are not. If you are having false negatives (missing a match), double the threshold until you get a match. 

  -If you want new defaults, edit on config.txt. Please be careful and keep the format I put.

  -Also, please be careful doing this, as you can get kicked for being a bot. I know because it happened to me once while testing already :( It seems to have happend because of a nosy player who got an admin as opposed to somethingn automated, but I cannot be sure so USER BEWARE!

  -If you are doing shiny hunting, 0.3 seems to work just fine for most things, however this program has only caught shinys that are different color shade than their non-shiny counterparts.It sometimes struggles with shinys like Pidgey which variation is very slight. 

  -Please test before usage as while this works well on my machine, I cannot vouch for yours.

  I tried to make it dummy proof but if you manage to break it, tell me how!
