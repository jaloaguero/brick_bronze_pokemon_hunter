w###CONFIG FILE###

#This file can be used to tweak the values of the .exe. Generally you can leave these alone if you don't want
#to mess with them. However, if you do decide to change them, please change only the part after the '=' with
#no spaces, and nothing else. For example: "number=2" if you want to change it to 3, it should then look like
#"number=3". "number = 3", or "NUMBER=3" or "number=    3" or "number =3" will not work. 
#This file needs to be next to the .exe file for it to work.

#THRESHOLD
#The threshold basically how "close" the images have to be before they match. The lower the number, the closer they
#are. 0 means they are the exact same, but this is unreachable, because there is no way to create 2 images that 
#are exactly the same. The lower the number, the closer they are. 

#Please note that these numbers are what I found to work best on my system, but maybe yours will need a little 
#tweaking. 
#.3 basically has no false negatives, but has trouble differentiating between 2 pokemon that have color differences.
#.2 I have not seen fail, might every once in a while, and does better at differentiating shinies. 
#.15 is enough for the sprites from the pokemon brick bronze website to work
#.13125 seems to work mostly fine, but has false negatives
#.134375 has some false positives
#.133 is between thosee but also has false positives
#.132125 also has false positives, but not very frequently. However, this is finicky when we get to this level, as 
#half the time 2 images that are the exact same will/won't be flagged positive/negative due to random
#changes in pixels and whatnot.
#The default should be .15

#if it is saying you found pokemon you did not, number should go down, if it is saying that Pokemon that are a match
aren't, then this number should go up. 

threshold=.3
